## About

Columbus is an app to discover new places while traveling !

It tracks all your whereabouts throughout the day and lets you bookmark any memorable sites that come along your way, 
like restaurants, shops, photo-worthy sceneries and more ! Your travel routes can be shared with family, friends [or anyone around the globe to show them what the world has to offer].

Are you ready to take over the world?
